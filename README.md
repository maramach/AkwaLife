# AkwaLife
Global Hackathon 2023 - AkwaLife - ensuring water quality for humans and planet
1. We are focused on ingesting data from a public source covering water quality in the US since many recent studies (see notes at bottom) have pointed to overwhelming issues here. Beyond hack week we would consider expanding data sources and countries.
The public data source is provided by the [National Water Quality Monitoring Council](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/orgs/) and covers 3 contributing organisations.

2. We are working with Azure and Azure Synapse for managing the data and will be considering Fabric down the line.

3. A highly usable, mobile front end is critical for end users to engage with this kind of data so that its simple to get relevant insights that are actionable. We will focus on iOS for the hack and use of PowerApps and PowerBI to put a prototype together as the easiest and quickest path to an MVP.

4. Users should be able to view the water quality status in their area simply and understand the main factors effecting it. Education and awareness will be a key part of the App function. We are also bringing in AI elements (CoPilot like) such as use of text prompts as an easy way to query data and for predictive analytics.

5. **The Future:**

  Monetization - Involve affiliates like water filter providers and water companies 

  Include local data at point of use (sensors at kitchen tap)
